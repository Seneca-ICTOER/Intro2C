Unary `+`, `-` and `*` have higher precedence than the binary forms. The operator `()` refers to function call.

**Precedence** determines the order in which operands are bound to operators. Operators on the same line have the same precedence; rows are in order of decreasing precedence. C does _not_ specify the order in which the operands of an operator are evaluated. Similarly, the order in which function arguments are evaluated is not specified. Examples:

```c
// Example-1:
x = f() + g();

// Example-2:
a[i] = i++;

// Example-3:
printf("%d %d\n",++n,power(2,n));

// Example-4:
z = x / ++x;
```

Programs should not depend upon the order of evaluation of expressions, except as guaranteed by ANSI C for the following operators:

```
 1.  a, b           comma operator (not the comma between arguments)
 2.  a && b         logical and
 3.  a || b         logical or
 4.  a ? b : c      conditional
```

All of these guarantee that expression `a` will be computed before expression `b` (or `c`).

In addition, when a function-call takes place all arguments are evaluated before control transfers to the function.

```
 5.  a(b) function call
```

ANSI C++ guarantees that each full expression will be evaluated before going on.

```
6. each full expression
```
